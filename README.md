**App Idea - "PlantBuddy": A Plant Care Companion**

Description:
For those with green thumbs and those without, PlantBuddy is a friendly guide to plant care. Whether youâ€™re growing basil on your windowsill or nurturing a rare orchid, PlantBuddy reminds you to water, fertilize, and care for your plants based on their specific needs, ensuring they thrive and brighten up your living space.

Features:
Plant Profile: Create a profile for each plant, inputting its type (either by selecting from a list or entering manually), the date you acquired it, and uploading a photo.

Watering Reminders: Based on the type of plant, the app sends friendly reminders about watering. Users can adjust the frequency based on their observations and the plant's condition.

Fertilizing and Repotting Alerts: Not all plants need frequent fertilizing or repotting, but when they do, the app sends timely alerts.

Sunlight Tracker: Using the phone's location, the app can remind users to move their plants to shadier spots or provide more sunlight depending on the plant's requirements.

Plant Health Diagnostics: Upload a photo of a plant that seems to be in distress, and the app will provide basic diagnostics and care suggestions based on visible symptoms.
